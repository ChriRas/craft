# CRAFT Profile

> Per-project CRAFT operating profile — autonomy, commit, merge, language, and model
> settings consumed by CRAFT commands. **Portable:** copy this file into a sibling
> project to reuse the setup. Auto-read on every `/craft:prime`. This file **is** the
> effective config — when it is absent, the plugin defaults apply (see
> `craft-profile-defaults.md`). Generated/edited via `/craft:onboard`; safe to hand-edit.
>
> Lives at `.claude/project/craft-profile.md`. May freely deviate from any preset.
>
> **autonomous** — fewest interruptions: like `balanced` (worktree builds, per-sub-task
> commits, direct merge to `main`, parallel epics) but with a broad permission allowlist
> so routine in-project operations run without prompts. Use on repos you fully trust.

> Preset: autonomous

## Execution

> How `/craft:execute` runs work. `worktree` is the parallel-safe path (slices build in
> throwaway git worktrees outside the repo). `in-place` builds on a branch in the main
> checkout so you can inspect the raw diff in your IDE.

- **Mode:** worktree

## Commit Policy

> `Auto-commit: off` holds all changes uncommitted until you release them — only valid
> in the `in-place` path. The `worktree` path **always** auto-commits (its merge model
> depends on per-sub-task commits), so `Auto-commit: off` + `Mode: worktree` is invalid.
>
> `Co-Authored-By: on` makes `/craft:commit` append the trailer
> `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>` to each commit message. Default `off`.

- **Auto-commit:** on
- **Co-Authored-By:** off

## Merge Workflow

> How a finished slice/epic lands. `pull-request` + `Protected-main: yes` is the
> "Freigabe ≠ Merge" flow: the human **approves** the PR (does not merge by hand) and
> the system merges via `gh` once the approval exists.

- **Type:** direct
- **Protected-main:** no
- **Approval:** chat
- **Approval-granularity:** auto

## Epic Mode

> Default decomposition execution for `/craft:execute <epic>`. `parallel` is the
> existing worktree mechanic; `sequential` runs slices one-by-one in place, committing
> per slice with a review halt between them.

- **Default:** parallel

## Permissions

> Records which permission-scope preset onboarding applied. The actual allowlist entries
> live in `.claude/settings.local.json` — this field is documentation only, never a
> duplicate of the allowlist.

- **Scope:** broad

## Operational Language

> Three independent language settings. Consumed by `/craft:prime` (reports them),
> `/craft:commit` (commit-message language), and `/craft:build` / `/craft:review`
> (code-comment language). Defaults: Chat = system language, Commits = English,
> Comments = English.

- **Chat:** system
- **Commits:** English
- **Comments:** English

## Agent Model Overrides

> Override CRAFT subagent models (defaults in `model-defaults.md`). Allowed values:
> `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `inherit`. An empty block means "use defaults".
> `/craft:prime` reports the effective model and soft-warns on invalid entries.

<!--
Examples (uncomment to use):

- slice-builder: opus     # heavier judgment for risky migrations
- code-reviewer: sonnet   # faster review for low-stakes slices
